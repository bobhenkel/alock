ALOCK(1)
========
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
alock - locks the local X display until the correct password is entered


SYNOPSIS
--------
*alock* [-h] [-auth type:opts] [-bg type:opts] [-cursor type:opts] [-input type:opts]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*Alock* is a simple screen lock application, which locks the X server until
the correct password is provided. If the authentication was successful, the X
server is unlocked and the user can continue to work. When *alock* is started
it just waits for the first keypress. This first keypress is to indicate that
the user now wants to type in the password. Such a behavior might seem to be
annoying at the first glance, however this approach is chosen due to security
reasons.

Note, that *alock* does not provide any fancy animations like 'xlock' and
'xscreensaver' and probably never will. It's just for locking the current X
session.

        * list - display available hashing algorithms
        * type=<type> - use <type> hashing algorithm
        * hash=<hash> - use <hash> as reference
        * file=<filename> - use content of <filename> as reference

*-bg* 'type:options'::
    Define the type of how alock should handle the background:
