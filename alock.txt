NAME
----
alock - locks the local X display until the correct password is entered.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'alock' [-h] [-bg type:opts] [-cursor type:opts] [-auth type:opts] [-input type:opts]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'alock' locks the X server until the user enters the correct password at the
keyboard. If the authentification was successful, the X server is
unlocked and the user can continue to work. When 'alock' is started it just
waits for the first keypress. This first keypress is to indicate that the user
now wants to type in the password.

Note, that 'alock' does not provide fancy animations like 'xlock' and
'xscreensaver' and never will. It's just for locking the current X session.
